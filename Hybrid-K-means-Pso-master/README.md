# Hybrid-K-means-Pso(MATLAB)
An advanced version of K-Means using Particle swarm optimization for clustering of high dimensional data sets, which converges faster to the optimal solution.    

“Clustering” is a technique that is employed to partition elements in a data set such
that similar elements are assigned to same cluster while elements with different
properties are assigned to different clusters. Fast and high-quality document clustering
algorithms play an important role in effectively navigating, summarizing, and
organizing information. Partitional clustering algorithms are more suitable for
clustering large datasets.
In this project we are going to implement a hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization
(PSO) with K-means document clustering algorithm that performs fast document
clustering and can avoid being trapped in a local optimal solution on various high
dimensional datasets. The hybrid PSO with K-means algorithm combines the ability
of the globalized searching of the PSO algorithm and the fast convergence of the K-
means algorithm. The results obtained are analyzed and compared for accuracy and
performance of the algorithm on large datasets.

=================================================================================================================================

Copy all the gui files if you also want gui along with the code. Else just copy the respective Kmeans.m, KPSO.m and KPSOK.m files of the data of your requirement and execute them in the same order. All the data files are also included.

The entire information, background and results are present in the doc2.pdf in detail.
